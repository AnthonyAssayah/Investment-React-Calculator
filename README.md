<h1>Investment Calculator React</h1>

This React-based Investment Calculator helps users estimate their investment growth over time. The calculator takes initial investment, annual investment, expected investment return, and duration as inputs. It then calculates and displays the projected investment values, interest earned, and total invested capital over the specified duration.

**Files:**
1. **App.jsx:** Main component managing state and rendering header, user input form, and results table.
2. **Header.jsx:** Component rendering the header with the project's logo and title.
3. **UserInput.jsx:** Component rendering the form for user input of investment parameters.
4. **Results.jsx:** Component calculating and displaying investment results in a table format.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open the browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` to use the Investment Calculator.

**Note:** Ensure all input values are valid numbers, and review the calculation logic in `Results.jsx` if encountering any issues with result display.
